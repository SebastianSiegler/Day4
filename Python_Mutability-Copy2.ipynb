    "Tuples are simply the immutable brother/sister of the `list`. Tuples are immutable, ordered collections. This means that once a tuple is instantiated, all you can do is access its contents. You cannot make a tuple longer. You cannot reassign what is in a tuple (there are some subtleties to this which we will discuss shortly). Similar to lists, tuples are declared by passing an iterable to the `tuple()` constructor, with or without the syntactic sugary parenthesis (this works because Python automatically interprets comma separated things that aren't specifically specified otherwise as tuples)."

    "You might be asking yourself what a tuple can store? The answer is, just as with lists, anything! Just as with lists, the elements of tuples can be accessed via zero-based indexing, and looped through with a `for` loop. And just as with lists, the elements in a tuple can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous (know though, that there are structures in Python that enforce homogeneity). Let's stick with looking at tuples for now, and take a look at some of the things we can store."

This works because Python, upon accessing the contents of `t` at index 1, will find a list. It will then immediately call the `append()` method on that structure. This concept of being able to act on data structures that you don't necessarily know the contents of is very powerful, and we will use it time and again.\n",
